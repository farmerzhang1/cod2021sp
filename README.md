these are the labs from ``Computer Organization and Design`` of USTC CS Dept, 2021 spring.

虽然代码成分 vhdl(xilinx vivado的ip核) 占了大头，但是手写的部分只有每个lab里面的*_chisel/src/main/scala/

at the end of semester i just didnt do anything, so the fifth lab is not done, and there should be a 'lab 6' where you can do whatever you want (a cache I thought)
